Bot name: Rocket Slayer
Language: Java 8


Any additional installation steps needed for your bot?
@
You need (for a total of 65 cars):
- 1 human player in the blue team,
- 44 Rocket Slayer bots in the blue team,
- 20 Rocket Slayer bots in the orange team.

Make sure you have at least Java 11 installed. Any newer version should work just fine.
I compiled the code with Java 11.
I only tested it on other computers with Java 17.

You should probably make sure you can run the bots without too much lag before the event.
When you run the bot, you should expect to see a loading at the bottom left of the screen. It should take ~10 seconds to load.
Once the loading is done, you should see a menu in the game. Don't press anything! Keep the surprise for the event :p
If you see the menu, you can try to move around the map a little to see if it's playable.
Keep in mind you are dealing with 65 cars in a game (64 bots + you), this puts a huge load on your computer's processor.
Closing any other non-necessary application might help a little.

I hope you enjoy it!

Any changed match settings? (Default = Soccar, 1vX, no mutators, standard map)
@
- Match length: Unlimited,
- Max score: 1 Goal.

Of course, don't forget to turn on rendering and state setting.
Any standard map is fine.

Any additional existing bots to be used?
